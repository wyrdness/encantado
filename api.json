      "full": "The Encantado are shapeshifting beings from Brazilian Amazon folklore who live as dolphins (usually pink river dolphins) but transform into beautiful humans at night. In human form, they appear as handsome men or beautiful women who are perfect dancers and party-goers, but they must always wear hats to hide their blowholes. They emerge from rivers during festivals and parties to seduce humans, with male Encantado often impregnating women and female Encantado seducing men. They may lure people to their underwater kingdom known as Encante. Unexplained pregnancies in Amazonian communities are traditionally blamed on Encantado, and children born under mysterious circumstances may be said to bear the Encantado's mark. Out of respect, river dolphins should never be called \\\"dolphins\\\" but rather \\\"boto,\\\" and it is dangerous to make eye contact with them during festivals. The Encantado represent the mystery and allure of the Amazon rivers and embody both indigenous and Portuguese cultural influences."
